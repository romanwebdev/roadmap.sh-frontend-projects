# Age Calculator

This project uses external packages via npm. Users can input their birthdate using a JavaScript Datepicker, and the app calculates and displays their exact age — including years and months — with the help of Luxon.
The application is bundled with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 

To check if Node.js is installed, run:

```sh
node -v
```

```

2. **Install project dependencies**

3. **Start the development server**
